# Project Snapshot - September 2025

## Current State
This document captures the current state of the Rate Monitor Pro project. The application is stable and the core MVP functionality is complete and ready for launch.

### Core Features
- ✅ User authentication and authorization with Supabase.
- ✅ Secure, server-side Stripe integration for subscription billing.
- ✅ A robust, end-to-end signup and payment flow that correctly handles redirects and user creation.
- ✅ Real-time rate monitoring via Supabase Edge Functions.
- ✅ A client management system with a dashboard overview.
- ✅ A basic notification system (database-driven).
- ✅ A complete marketing website.
- ✅ A persistent, single-display welcome modal for new users.

### Frontend Structure
- React + TypeScript + Vite.
- A well-organized component structure separated into `ui`, `layout`, and feature-specific folders.
- Modern routing with `createBrowserRouter`.

### Backend/Database
- Supabase for all backend services.
- A stable PostgreSQL database schema with RLS policies enforced.
- A suite of Edge Functions for handling server-side logic like payments and rate fetching.

### Known Issues
1. **FRED API Integration**: The current rate fetching logic may need to be updated or replaced for long-term production use.
2. **Bundle Size**: The production JavaScript bundle is large and could be optimized with code-splitting in the future.

### Next Steps
1. **Finalize Notification System**: Implement the target rate alert emails for brokers and clients.
2. **Build Out Settings Page**: Create the user settings and notification preferences page.
3. **Code Cleanup**: Begin the process of removing the legacy GoHighLevel integration code.
4. **Launch MVP**.
